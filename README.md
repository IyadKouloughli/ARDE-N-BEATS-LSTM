# 🧠 ARDE-N-BEATS-LSTM: Hybrid Time Series Forecasting with ARDE, N-BEATS, and LSTM

This repository presents an experimental hybrid architecture combining:
- **Adaptive Reinitialized Differential Evolution (ARDE)** for optimizing model parameters,
- **N-BEATS** (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series) for interpretable deep learning forecasting,
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data.

The model is evaluated on 15-minute interval time series data and demonstrates an advanced approach to short-term forecasting using evolutionary and neural-based architectures.
